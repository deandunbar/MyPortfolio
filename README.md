### KeySilence - [Tool Repo](https://github.com/HackerIndustrial-Tooling/SilentSuite/blob/main/key_silence/README.md)
```
silently unlocks macOS Keychain and extracts Chrome Safe Storage credentials
using native macOS APIs with no security binary calls—bypassing typical EDR detection techniques.
```

### C2go - [Tool Repo](https://github.com/HackerIndustrial-Tooling/C2go)
```
A very simple c2 in golang with matching cross platform agent.
Made for quick remote testing during agent development.
```

### rektwallet - [Repo](https://github.com/HackingWeb3/rektwallet)
```
rektwallet is a deliberately vulnerable Bitcoin wallet written in Python.
It demonstrates how poor nonce reuse in ECDSA signatures can lead to
full private key compromise.
Includes a lab environment, vulnerable implementation, and exploit scripts.

## Cryptocurrency 

### Monero Diceware seed generator [MoneroDice-WalletGen](https://github.com/Monero-HackerIndustrial/MoneroDice-WalletGen)
```
Offline Monero Seed Generating using Dice rolls as a source of entropy. 
Can be used in an offline/airgapped machine to create cold 
wallet address seeds. 
```

### Monerosigner [Monerosigner CCS](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/MoneroSigner.html)
```
Monero specific fork of seedsigner called Monerosigner. Monerosigner is an offline signing hardware wallet built around the raspberry pi zero SBC.

```
This is *Vanity Walk* — a hands-on, code-first journey into Ethereum key generation and vanity address brute-forcing.  
Built in Go with no magic libraries. Just curves, Keccak, and ~~goroutines~~ *(not yet)*.
```

### Ethernaut Solutions [Solutions Repo](https://github.com/HackingWeb3/EthernautSolutions) 
```
The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame. 
This is a link to a repo containing examples of 
the malicious code I used to win the associated level.
Shows applied usage of malicious solidity code to exploit vulnerable 
solidity contracts. Used Brownie as my web3 framework
